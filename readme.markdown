A collection of nifty little things I've done with AVRs outside the warm embrace of the Arduino IDE. They share the nice-things.c file which I've slowly developed as a nicer little abstraction to some core AVR functionality - intended to be extremely thin and lightweight. Most of these projects were prototyped and run on attiny85s - they might work on other processors, or they might not.
